# 🌟 FlashBack

Think your memory is top-notch? Prove it! FlashBack is a fast-paced, light-up-the-cubes memory game designed to challenge (and maybe frustrate) you. With a modern, clean design, this game is deceptively simple—until the sequences start getting wild.


## 🚀 Features

- **Sleek, Minimalist Interface**: A simple 2x2 grid that looks easy... until you’re five flashes deep and sweating bullets.
- **Increasing Complexity**: Each round adds another flash to remember. It’s you vs. your brain. May the best one win.
- **Score Tracking**: Rack up points and try to top your own high score—or let your friends know who’s the memory champ.
- **Fluid Animations**: Smooth and responsive flashes that make the game feel oh-so-satisfying (even when you lose).
- **Subtle Sound Effects**: Just enough audio to keep things interesting, but not enough to get you kicked out of the library.


## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Press any key** to start. Easy enough, right?
2. Watch as the cube faces flash in a sequence. Memorize it (or at least try to).
3. **Click** the cube faces in the exact order. Feel the pressure yet?
4. As the game progresses, the sequences grow longer and more intense. Stay sharp!
5. Make a mistake? Your score will be displayed, and you can press any key to play again.


## 🔧 Technical Details

- **Built With**: Good ol’ HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript. Pure, uncut code with zero dependencies.
- **Responsive Design**: Whether you’re on a phone, tablet, or that massive desktop monitor, the game adjusts beautifully.
- **Well-Structured Code**: Modular JavaScript keeps things neat and easy to manage.
